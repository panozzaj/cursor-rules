## Python versions / virtualenv

Use a virtual environment for cleanly managing Python versions and packages

## Python packages

Manage solely through [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt)
Sort dependencies alphabetically whenever modifying the file
Whenever installing a package with pip, add it to [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt) first

Install it through `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### pip install --upgrade pip

Install pip updates if you see a notice about them when installing another package.

Example:

```
[fake notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.0 -> 25.0.1
[fake notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip
```
