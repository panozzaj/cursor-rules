# Requirements Maintenance Rules

Requirements hold the high-level requirements for the project.

All features must be added to a well-named file in the `requirements` folder

## Adding New Features

- Each feature must be described in detail, including its purpose and requirements
- Use subfolders of `requirements` to organize related features
- Use GitHub-style checkboxes `- [ ]` for all features
- Place new features in the most appropriate file
- If no appropriate file exists, create a new one
- Put a descriptive comment at the top of each file (e.g. "# User Authentication Features")

## Implementing Features

- Update checkbox to `- [x]` when feature is fully implemented
- Add implementation details as sub-items if needed
- Keep requirements synchronized with actual implementation

## Validation

- Verify requirements match implemented features
- Remove or update outdated requirements
- Resolve conflicts between requirements and implementation
- Keep track of dependencies between features
