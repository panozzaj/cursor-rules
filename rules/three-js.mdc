# Three (library)

Ensure that all THREE.Vectors correctly have a closing parenthesis at the end.
Otherwise we get a syntax error.

Example of failure case:

```
        startPoint = new THREE.Vector3(
          points[0].x,
          points[0].y,
          points[0].z + startPercent * stripeLength * Math.sign(points[1].z - points[0].z)
    }
```

Example of success case:

```
        endPoint = new THREE.Vector3(
          points[0].x,
          points[0].y,
          points[0].z + endPercent * stripeLength * Math.sign(points[1].z - points[0].z)
        )
```

Definitely do not fix with sed and/or create .bak files.
