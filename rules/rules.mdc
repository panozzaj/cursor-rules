# Rules (meta)

Rule rules:

 - To add a new rule, create a file in .cursor/rules with .mdc extension
 - Use kebab-case for rule filenames
 - Do not use leading numbers for rule filenames

Good rule filename examples:

 - .cursor/rules/my-new-rule.mdc
 - .cursor/rules/some-folder/my-new-rule.mdc  (it's ok to have subfolders for organization)

Bad rule filename examples (with reason for being problematic):

 - .cursor/rules/00-my-new-rule.mdc  (has leading numbers)
 - .cursor/rules/my_new_rule.mdc     (uses underscores instead of dashes)
 - .cursorrules                      (not under .cursor/rules)

All rule files must have the following frontmatter:

```
---
description: <Several word text description of the rule>
globs: <any file globs that this should apply to>
alwaysApply: <true if global, otherwise false>
---
...then the rest of the file is standard Markdown...
```

If the user prompts you to add a rule, follow the process above.
If the user says to "always" do something, add a new rule for it.
If you make the same mistake more than once, add a new rule for it.

See [markdown.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/markdown.mdc) for rules around Markdown formatting.
