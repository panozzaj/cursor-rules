# Run RSpec Tests After Edit

When an RSpec file (`spec/**/*_spec.rb`) is created or edited, run the tests within that file to verify the changes and catch any regressions or errors.

Use a command like:

```sh
# Run all tests in the file
./bin/rspec path/to/your_spec.rb

# Run a specific test by line number (useful after adding/modifying one test)
./bin/rspec path/to/your_spec.rb:line_number
```

Debug and fix any failures that arise before proceeding.
