If you encounter Ruby `unless` guards, they are OK to use.

If you see them in existing code and aren't changing the functionality, keep
them as-is unless the line gets really long or the logic is confusing.

Example of something that's OK to keep:

```ruby
def some_method(candidate, scenario)
  unless scenario_solution = QualifiedService.get_challenge_results(candidate, scenario)
    raise 'No solution found'
  end
```

I (Anthony) find that this makes the code a little easier to read and follow.

Please don't comment on the fact that you are doing this in the code though.
