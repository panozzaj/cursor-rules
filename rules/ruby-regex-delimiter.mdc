# Use %r{} for **Ruby** Regex Literals Containing Slashes

When a regular expression literal contains one or more forward slashes (`/`), use the `%r{...}` syntax instead of the default `/.../` syntax.

This improves readability by avoiding the need for excessive escaping of the forward slash character within the regex pattern.

**Good:**

```ruby
pattern = %r{/some/path/}
```

**Bad:**

```ruby
pattern = /\/some\/path\//
```

Note that printing off regular expressions may still have escaped slashes.
