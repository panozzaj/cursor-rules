# Keyboard interrupt Handling

I will sometimes terminate a terminal / console command.

When you observe a KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C, ^C, SIGINT) in command output:

1. Treat it as an indication that the command may have failed or had issues.
2. Do not assume the command completed successfully.
3. Inspect the terminal output closely.
4. Consider the need to diagnose and fix any underlying issues that led to the
   interruption.
5. Propose improvements to prevent the need for manual interruption.
