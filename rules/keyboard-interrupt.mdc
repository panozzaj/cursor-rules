# Keyboard interrupt Handling

I will sometimes terminate a terminal / console command.

When you observe a KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C, ^C, SIGINT) in command output:

1. Treat it as an indication that the command failed or had issues
2. Do not assume the command completed successfully
3. Consider the need to diagnose and fix the underlying issue that led to the interruption
4. Propose improvements to prevent the need for manual interruption
