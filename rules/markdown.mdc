# Markdown Rules

## Headers

- All headers must be followed by exactly one blank line
- Use ATX-style headers (`#` syntax) rather than underline style
- Maximum of three header levels in most cases
- Header text should be concise and descriptive

See [rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rules.mdc) for specific rules for .mdc files.
